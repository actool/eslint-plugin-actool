## New rule

First of all, thank you so much for this idea and suggestion! 👍

This small guide should help you to implement your own rule for `eslint-plugin-actool`

1. Look at [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) 
2. Run [eslint rule generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-eslint#eslintrule)
```sh
$ npm run new:rule

? What is your name? # {YOUR_NAME}
? Where will this rule be published? # ESLint Plugin
? What is the rule ID? # {RULE_NAME}
? Type a short description of this rule: # {RULE_DESCRIPTION}
? Type a short example of the code that will fail: # (Can be ommited and specified later)
```

It's all for a while)

If you have any questions - [official guide](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-plugins) can help you, I think

> Happy hacking!
